Xebec is a voice assistant being made using Python integrates speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and automation to execute user commands efficiently. This project demonstrates Python's capabilities in natural language processing and human-computer interaction.

Features
Speech Recognition: Uses libraries like speechrecognition to process voice input.

Text-to-Speech: Converts responses into speech using pyttsx3 or other TTS libraries.

Command Execution: Automates tasks like opening applications, fetching information, and interacting with APIs.

Customizable Responses: Allows users to enhance functionality with personalized commands.

Technologies Used
Python

speechrecognition (for voice input)

pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech output)

pyaudio (audio handling)

openai or nltk (for advanced NLP,)

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository.

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
Run the script:

bash
python voice_assistant.py
Future Enhancements
Adding AI-powered responses using NLP models.

Integrating with smart home devices.

Expanding command libraries for automation.
